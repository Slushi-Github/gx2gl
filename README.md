# gx2gl - Translate OpenGL calls to GX2 calls

Work-In-Progress OpenGL implementation for the Nintendo Wii U. 

Inspired by VitaGL and my thirst for Sonic 3 A.I.R. on the Wii U

"Because ANGLE wasn't enough." - siahisaforker, February 12, 2026  -# even though angle is something completely different anyway..

# Please read!!

!!This project is being used as a learning device. It is NOT production ready, and by using it you acknowledge that it is NOT accurate and will not be for a long time.

# gx2vk

The current `gx2vk` slice is intentionally narrow:

- instance / physical device / logical device creation

- Vulkan 1.3 feature advertisement for `dynamicRendering`, `synchronization2`, and `maintenance4`

- queue, command-pool, and command-buffer scaffolding

- `vkCmdBeginRendering` / `vkCmdEndRendering`

- `vkCmdPipelineBarrier2`

- `vkGetDeviceBufferMemoryRequirements`

`gx2vk_test.rpx` is a loader smoke test, not a renderer yet. It should hold:

- green on success

- red on failure

Don't use gx2vk. I'm warning you.
